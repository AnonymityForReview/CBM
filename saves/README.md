Pre-trained backbones.

In our experiments,  the pre-training strategy is adopted fortraining efficiency and model performance.  
The file trainer.py in this package is used  to  pre-train the feature extractor.

You can also directly use the pre-trained backbones to initialize the meta-learners, as detailed in https://github.com/Sha-Lab/FEAT.
